# Performance Matters @cmda-minor-web Â· 2018-2019
### Jesse Dijkman

For this course, we're going to enhance the performance of our earlier created [apps for the OBA (library of Amsterdam).](https://github.com/jesseDijkman1/project-1-1819).

## Process
The first thing I did, was build the entire app kind of from scratch. I learned about some tricks with `<input type="hidden">` and used this to make a fully server-sided app. The app can be used without JavaScript. I then added gulp, to get used to minification. And finally I added a service-worker and implemented caching.

## Audits

I focussed a bit on the audits, because it's an easy way of spotting areas for improvement.
